From a historical perspective, it's interesting because it predates some more well-known and widely read books on the same theme (1984 and Brave New World). From a narrative perspective, it's interesting because it is first-person diary entries from a future civilization to an unknown audience (us!). It drags a little in the middle, like so many books, and sometimes is confusing but that could be the translation, I don't know. Overall though I enjoyed it and found it very thoughtful.

They were all related but also distinct, and gave me some insight into a different culture and lifestyle. I loved that Tevye was always doing things ""not like a woman"" but he still deeply loved his daughters and showed it. <br/><br/>The other stories were The Railroad Stories and they are okay but they aren't as good. They are more of unrelated vignettes and I find it difficult to get into them. On the other hand, they are short, so by the time I'm bored it's over!",,,1,,,0,,,,,
